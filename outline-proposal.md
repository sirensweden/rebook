* Part intro: **Requirements in Context**
  * *What is a requirement?*
    * Different kinds of requirements
    * Requriements at different levels
      * Goal-design-scale
    * Requirements as ideas, decisions, system propoerties, ...
    * Quality vs function

  * *RE in Software Development*
    * RE and Testing
    * RE and System Architecture
    * RE and SW Design, UX, HCI, Usability...
    * RE and Project Management
      * states of requriements (-> Release Planning)
      * funnel from ideas to implementation
    * RE and System Operation (Devops, feedback loops, continuous deployment etc)
    * RE as a communication process
      * Communication distances
  * What is special with RE in Systems Engineering?
    * Safety-critical systems

  * Ethics in RE
    * Make systems that are friendly to users and their planet
    * Systems that spy on humans
    * Systems that may kill humans
    * Engineering ethics frameworks

* Part elici: **Elicitation and Innovation**
  * Goals of elicitation
  * Stakeholder analysis
  * Interacting with stakeholders in elicitation 
    * ??? verlap with validation; focus here on discovery of future system properties ???
    * Interviews
    * Demonstration
    * Surevys
    * Usability testing
    * Online data collection of system usage
      * big data
  * Creativity
    * Brainstorming, focus groups
  * Innovation
    * Open innovation
* Part speci: **Specification and Modelling**
  * State and data
    * Representing what the system stores, data, databases
  * Function and actions
    * Representing the realtion between input and output
  * Quality and goals
    * Quality requirements
      * Different kinds of quality
      * Trade-off among quality requirements
      * QUPER 
    * Goals modelling
      * helps, hurts
* Part prio: **Prioritization and Decision-Making**
  * Decisions that need to be taken
    * What to implement?
    * When to release?
    * How much effort on RE? When are we ready with requirements?
  * Prioritization techniques
    * Ordinal vs ratio-scale techniques
    * 100$
    * sorting
  * Release planning

    * QUPER roadmap view
  
* Part valid: **Validation and Feedback**
  * Requirements quality
  * Checklists
  * Inspection
  * Automatic support to find flaws
    * NLP, machine learning etc.
  * Feedback from stakeholders in validation 
    * ??? overlap with elicitation; focus here on finding problems ???
    * Interviews
    * Demonstration
    * Surevys
    * Usability testing
    * Online data collection of system usage
